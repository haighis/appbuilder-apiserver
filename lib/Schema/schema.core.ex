# Functional Core
# A Schema libary that is developed as a functional core.
# The functional core is library implementation.
# The functional core should work on data thatâ€™s validated and safe. It should be predictable, so it avoids side effects.
# A functional core is means to easily reason about the application core business logic that is the same pattern
# created by James Edward Gray and Bruce A. Tate found in the book "Designing Elixir Systems with OTP".
#
# Design
# The Schema uses
# - Ecto Adapter Repository pattern
# Usage
# Schema.Core.get_all
# Schema.Core.save("Page","PAGE","someschema","uischema")
# Schema.Core.update(1,"Page","PAGE","someschema","uischema")
# Schema.Core.delete_by_id(1)
# Schema.Core.get_by_id(1)
